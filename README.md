# 🌾 Smart Farming Advisor (AI-based Agricultural Assistant)

The **Smart Farming Advisor** is an AI-powered agricultural guidance system that helps farmers make better decisions about crop management.  
It uses natural language understanding (NLP), translation, and intelligent retrieval to generate *dynamic*, context-aware farming advice — not static answers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧑‍🌾 **AI-Powered Question Answering**  
  Generates smart, situation-based advice for each query using FAISS and Sentence Transformers.

- 🌍 **Bilingual Support (English & Hindi)**  
  Automatically translates both user queries and AI-generated responses for inclusivity.

- 📊 **Smart Knowledge Retrieval**  
  Uses FAISS vector search to find the most relevant farming advice from your datasets.

- 🧾 **PDF Report Generator**  
  Converts AI advice into a downloadable PDF (supports Unicode text).

- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**  
  Reads out generated advice for accessibility and ease of use.

- 📁 **Auto Dataset Detection**  
  Automatically detects CSV files in the app folder — no manual dataset selection required.

- 💻 **Streamlit Responsive UI**  
  A modern, bilingual web interface that works on both desktop and mobile screens.
